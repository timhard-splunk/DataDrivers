# Be Data Driven.  Join Data Drivers!
Join Splunk’s IT Strategists and The Big Data Beard for Data Drivers; an iRacing Championship Series and Hands-on Hackathons to learn how Splunk’s powerful IT tools turn racing data into action!

ICYMI, The Big Data Beard team hosted the Virtual Race To .conf20, a broadcast of a Championship Racing Series on the iRacing.com platform in the 10 days leading up to .conf20.  They also created an easy way to get more than 300 metrics out of iRacing and into Splunk which they used to surface insights into the racing action and created the most played BOTN scenario of .conf20!
